The Event Table Viewer is a visualization for analyzing event data along with categorical and numerical data columns in a tabular layout. Multiple event types can be displayed per row on a shared time scale. Events can be aligned by one event type and sorted. A boxplot shows the event distribution of similar data for comparison. The table can be grouped, sorted and filtered by multiple columns. Visualization types for cells, group summaries and column summaries can be customized for each column.
